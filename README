Repository to keep track of implementations/exercises as I work through 'The Algorithm Design Manual' (S. Skiena, 3rd Ed.).

DICTIONARIES:

Implemented an unsorted dictionary data structure using 3 different storage methods: static array, singly linked list, and doubly linked list. Each implementation covers 7 core functions: search(), insert(), delete(), min(), max(), predecessor(), successor(). Adhered to target time complexities as described in textbook. 

BINARY SEARCH TREES:

Implemented a binary search tree. Covered core functions of search() , insert(), delete(), min(), max(), predecessor(), successor(), and traversal(). Adhered to target time complexities as described in textbook.
